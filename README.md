# Advance-security-audit-on-NodeGoat-application
This is the final and last working of mine on this NodeGoat application. Updated code and the detailed document of the task is available here. It was a long journey with this application. Including a bunch of sleepless nights, non stop working hours. It can be tricky when working with a web application but it can never be boring.


1. Security Audits & Compliance
● Conduct security audits using:
○ OWASP ZAP
○ Nikto
○ Lynis
● Check compliance with OWASP Top 10 best practices.

2. Secure Deployment Practices
● Enable automatic security updates and dependency scanning.
● Follow Docker security best practices, including scanning container images for
vulnerabilities.

3. Final Penetration Testing
● Perform a comprehensive penetration test using tools like Burp Suite or Metasploit.
